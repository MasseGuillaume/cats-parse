See this blog post detailing the design. To reiterate, this library has a few goals:\nCompatability: should work on all scala platforms and recent versions. Currently it supports JVM, JS on versions 2.12, 2.13, and Dotty. The core library should have minimal dependencies. Currently this library only depends on cats. Excellent performance: should be as fast or faster than any parser combinator that has comparable scala version support. Cats friendliness: method names match cats style, and out of the box support for cats typeclasses. Precise errors: following the Haskell Trifecta parsing library, backtracking is opt-in vs opt-out. This design tends to make it easier to write parsers that point correctly to failure points. Safety: by separating Parser0, a parser that may consume no input, from Parser, a parser must consume at least one character on success. Most combinators and methods can be made safer to use and less prone to runtime errors. Stability: we are very reluctant to break compatibility between versions. We want to put a minimal tax on users to stay on the latest versions.","title":"cats-parse"},{"location":"/index.html#an-example","text":"Below is most of a json parser (the string unescaping is elided).

Jawn is a specialized and optimized JSON parser, so that can be considered an upper bound on performance. Keep in mind that parser performance depends both on the parsing library but also how the parser is written, but these results suggest that this library is already quite competitive.","title":"Performance"},{"location":"/index.html#migrating-from-fastparse","text":"You should find all the Fastparse methods you are used to. If not, feel free to open an issue. There are a few things to keep in mind:\nIn fastparse, you wrap a parser in P(...) to make the interior lazy. Following cats, to get a lazily constructed parser use Parser.defer or cats.Defer[Parser].defer. In fastparse the ~ operator does tuple concatenation. This can be nice, but also complex to see what the resulting type is. In cats-parse, ~ always returns a Tuple2 containing the parsed values from the left and right. To recover fastparse-like behavior, use cats syntax (pa, pb, pc...).tupled. In fastparse, backtracking is opt-out by using cuts. In cats-parse, backtracking is opt-in using .backtrack. Put another way, normal product operations in cats-parse are like ~/ in fastparse. In cats-parse, using *>, <*, and .void methods can be a significant optimization: if you don’t need a result, communicate that to the library with those methods.","title":"Migrating from Fastparse"},{"location":"/index.html#getting-and-giving-help","text":"We welcome new contributors and new maintainers.
